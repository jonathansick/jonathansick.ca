abstract: "Doubly ionized carbon is an important, and many times the major, ionization state of carbon in planetary nebulae and HII regions. In this poster we report the results of imagery of five PNe (NGC 2392, NGC 3242, NGC 6543, NGC 6720, and NGC 7662) with the HST WFPC2 using the F185W filter, which includes emission from the C III]λλ1907,1909 line. These nebulae were chosen by (a) the strength of the CIII] emission in the UV based on archival IUE spectra, (b) having high surface brightness and sizes matching the WF CCDs on WFPC2, and (c) having a wealth of ground-based spectrophotometric observations along with archival HST WFPC2 observations in several prominent emission lines. In this poster we concentrate on presenting the results for two of the nebulae: NGC 7662 -'the blue snowball' - which has a relatively smooth symmetric double-ring structure, and NGC 2392 - 'the Eskimo' - which has a complex multi-ring inner structure and fliers in the outer parts. We present maps of these two nebulae in the line ratios of CIII]λ1909/[OIII]λ5007, HeIIλ4686/[OIII]λ5007, [SII]λ6723/[N II]λ6583, etc. and discuss the ionization structure of C+2 relative to H+ and other ions such as O+2, He+2, N+, and S+. For NGC 7662 we find that that CIII]/[OIII] ratio is nearly constant across the two shells, while for NGC 2392 we find significant variations in the CIII]/[OIII] ratio in the ring structures of the inner parts of the nebula. The variations may be due to stellar winds, density variations, or internal reddening. Support for the latter is given by a reddening map of NGC 2392 derived from the Hβ/Hα images, which show a rise in the reddening parameter C(Hβ) beyond the inner shell. Finally, some brief notes and pictures of CIII]/[OIII] in the other three PNe are given."
