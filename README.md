# JonathanSick.ca

This is the content and code for Jonathan Sick's [website](http://www.jonathansick.ca).
In this edition of the site, I'm using [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) to help generate the HTML from templates and markdown.
Lets also throw in some SASS, with a Susy responsive grid.

To develop, in separate terminals run

    jekyll --auto --server

and

    compass watch assets/

Then visit [http://localhost:4000/]()
